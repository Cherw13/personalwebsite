Through these observations, we recognize subtle nuances, identify patterns, and draw connections between the different locations. </h3>

These anecdotes share commonalities at the intersection of mobility navigation and safety. One common theme is the challenges faced in accessing <strong style="font-weight: 500;"> safe transportation</strong>. Delays, changes in routes, and limited availability of vehicles hinder individuals' ability to find reliable and timely transportation options. <strong style="font-weight: 500;">Communication gaps</strong> are also evident, as inadequate explanations for changes and underutilization of safety infrastructure create confusion and inconvenience.  Furthermore, there is a shared desire for <strong style="font-weight: 500;"> transportation options that are not only safe but also accessible and convenient, </strong> taking into account individual needs and ensuring a smooth journey.   </h3>

<strong style="font-weight: 550;"> Further Actions <br> <br> </strong>
1. Write to NYU <br> 
2. Speak with your local representatives  <br> 
3. Support communities pushing for public safety <br>

    <h3 class = "reflectionDescription" > 
   This was my first project that led me to learn about what is design thinking. In this process, we made a tangible creation of our waiting space concept through experience prototyping. Although at first, our project was only thought to solve our safety issue in terms of being comfortable and secured in public spaces, however it was not fixed. Through this prototype, we learn to understand and explore the variety of methods and mediums in which we can intervene and introduce new ways that other public waiting areas can adapt to be more convenient and safe. In general, when people feel more comfortable/knowledgeable/mobile about/in the spaces throughout their commute, they feel more secure with the choices they make, the communities they are a part of, the people they are around, and most importantly, the way they navigate to and from the places they need to be at certain times.
